Task: Add a new dark mode with blue colors
Started: 2026-02-10 19:16:00 (America/Sao_Paulo)

## Codebase Patterns
- Dashboard UI is defined entirely in src/server/index.html; npm run build copies it to dist/server/index.html.

## 2026-02-10 19:46:00 - dark-blue-mode: Add a blue dark mode
- Added a blue-themed dark palette plus a ternary theme toggle that cycles through light, dark, and the new blue mode.
- Files changed: src/server/index.html, dist/server/index.html, tests/theme-toggle.test.js, progress.txt.
- **Learnings:** The dashboard HTML/CSS/JS is maintained in src/server/index.html and bundled into dist/server/index.html during npm run build; theme toggles can be validated by parsing the markup via a lightweight Node test.
